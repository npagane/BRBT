TODO:
(other than general level development)
	AH! Big potential bug: variables declared in the level js files to render the code/animation MUST
	have variables distinct from those defined by the students dragging blocks
		maybe have to go back and append a weird thing to all the local variables
resizing blockly div in windows
	(ok just worked on this for a little... not reactive to window resizing but at least it fills the page on refresh
	also the same issue can be taken when using phaser grpahics but tbh i think we're good on this one now)
