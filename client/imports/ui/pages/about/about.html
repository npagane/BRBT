                BRBT (Biophysics Research for Baltimore Teens) is a Hopkins Biophysics initiative to provide 6-week paid summer internships to
                Baltimore City high school students to learn more about biophysics and its related sciences. Typically, the main skills learned
                throughout this experience are basic biochemistry, lab techniques, and some computation. Starting in the summer of 2019, the
                Roberts Lab will now offer a BRBT course that emphasizes the computational side of biophysics through GermCraft——a web application
                that allows students to code via draggable blocks to emphasize the logic of computer science rather than any language-specific syntax.
                The blocks were inherited and adapted from Google's Blockly, and the web application and backend development utilizes Meteor software.
                There are daily GermCraft coding exercises that reinforce the biology concepts learned earlier in the day with a computer science 
                framework that gradually increases in complexity. The ultimate goal of the GermCraft exercises is to allow the students to develop a
                simulation of cellular behavior and survival.<br/><br/>
                At the end of each week, there will be a server competition that allows the students to compete their cell simulations against each
                other to gather population statistics——and also to see which student created the most efficient cell! Throughout the course, time
                will be set aside to analyze server competition data to emphasize the importance of data collection and analysis/inference.
